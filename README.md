# ERC20-Transaction-Tracker
This repository refers to the StreamLit project available here: https://victor-denisov-erc20-transaction--cryptoportfoliotracker-jqfj9y.streamlit.app/

Enter a wallet address and a table of ERC-20 transactions will appear in tabular form. There is also functionality to select an erc-20 token to change the below graph. Feel free to fork the repo and add changes as you see fit!

Note that this project displays transactions and not the balance (thus you may see negative "ending" values. Not all transactions that affect the balance of a wallet may be captured here.
